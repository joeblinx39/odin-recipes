    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Editan Soup is a vegetable soup indigenous to the Ibibios and Efiks of the
      <br />
      Niger Delta region of Nigeria. It is one of many vegetable soups made
      in<br />
      this region. Editan leaf is usually paired with waterleaf just like<br />
      Edikang Ikong and Afang soup but it has a richer, more complex flavour<br />
      than both soups. The leaves can also be paired with okro for a delicious
      soup.

    <p>
      Editan leaf is naturally bitter like Bitter leaf, so it needs to be<br />
      processed to remove the bitterness before use, although some people cook<br />
      it without this step because they believe the bitterness has its own<br />
      medicinal value. Editan also gets slimy when it comes in contact with<br />
      water, so it needs to be washed well.
