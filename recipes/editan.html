    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Editan Soup is a vegetable soup indigenous to the Ibibios and Efiks of the
      <br />
      Niger Delta region of Nigeria. It is one of many vegetable soups made
      in<br />
      this region. Editan leaf is usually paired with waterleaf just like<br />
      Edikang Ikong and Afang soup but it has a richer, more complex flavour<br />
      than both soups. The leaves can also be paired with okro for a delicious
      soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Editan leaf is naturally bitter like Bitter leaf, so it needs to be<br />
      processed to remove the bitterness before use, although some people
      cook<br />
      it without this step because they believe the bitterness has its own<br />
      medicinal value. Editan also gets slimy when it comes in contact with<br />
      water, so it needs to be washed well.
    </p>

    <h3>INGREDIENTS:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups pounded Editan</li>
      <li>Meat</li>
      <li>Snail optional</li>
      <li>Ponmo (Cow skin)</li>
      <li>½ small onions chopped</li>
      <li>Stockfish head washed</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups Periwinkle/Isam In shell</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons ground crayfish</li>
      <li>Dry fish washed</li>
      <li>1 cup Palm oil</li>
      <li>fresh pepper</li>
      <li>4 seasoning cubes</li>
      <li>4 cups Shredded Waterleaf</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Using a mortar and pestle, pound shredded editan leaves or grind using a
        food processor or dry mill of a blender.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Place ground editan leaves into a bowl and add boiling water, enough to
        adequately cover it. Leave to stand for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Meanwhile place meat, ponmo and snails in a medium pot over medium-high
        heat, season with salt and one seasoning cube, <br> add chopped onions and
        little water, cover and cook until meat, ponmo and snails have softened.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        After 10 minutes, drain editan leaves using a chiffon cloth. Squeeze
        well to remove as much water as <br> possible, rinse in cold water, drain and
        squeeze well again, set aside.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Using a big knife cut off the tails of the periwinkle (or use a clean
        plier). Wash in several changes of water until the water is clear.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Rinse and add stockfish and cleaned periwinkle-in-shell (see below) to
        the boiling meat and cook for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Add crayfish, dryfish, palmoil, fresh pepper and three seasoning cubes.
        Stir, cover and cook until oil doesn't taste raw.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Add waterleaf, cook for five minutes.</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Sprinkle in the editan, cover and shake the pot, cook for five minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Stir, taste and correct seasoning.</li>
      <br />
      <li>Cover and cook for five minutes and take off the heat.</li>
      <br />
      <li>Serve with swallow of choice.</li>
    </ol>
