    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Afang soup is a traditional Nigerian soup made with a leafy green
      vegetable called "afang" or okazi, which is native to West Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soup is typically made with a variety of meats, such as beef, goat, or
      seafood, and is flavored with spices such as chili pepper, crayfish, and
      seasonings like onions and bouillon cubes. <br />
      It is often served with a carbohydrate staple like pounded yam or fufu.
      The soup is thick and rich, and is typically enjoyed as a main meal. It is
      often considered a delicacy and is often served on special occasions or to
      guests.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1kg Assorted meats (Beef, Smoked Turkey, Goat meat, Shaki, Ponmo, Cow
        leg are ideal)
      </li>
      <li>4 Bunches of Water leaves</li>
      <li>3 Cups Okazi/ Afang leaves</li>
      <li>2 Cooking Spoons Palm Oil</li>
      <li>1-2 Pieces Smoked Fish</li>
      <li>3 Pieces Stockfish</li>
      <li>2 Cups Periwinkles with or without the Shells on</li>
      <li>1-2 cooking spoons fresh ground Scotch Bonnet pepper</li>
      <li>1 Cooking Spoon Crayfish Powder</li>
      <li>2 Knorr Chicken Cubes</li>
      <li>1 Maggi Crayfish</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Boil the meats on high heat, starting with tougher meats first. Offals
        may be boiled separately if they are bloody. Add salt and Knorr Chicken
        Cubes and seasoning, onions are optional, I don’t use any. I gather
        onions aren’t needed when preparing authentic Afang soup. When the meats
        are almost soft, add the Smoked fish and continue to boil till very
        soft…
      </li>
      <li>
        While the meats are cooking, get the leaves ready. Slice and wash the
        Water leaves to remove all traces of dirt. Also wash and soak the Okazi/
        Afang leaves in hot water for 2 minutes. This process will help soften
        the Afang leaves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then transfer the Afang leaves into a blender, add a small amount of
        water, then blend to your preferred consistency. You may also Pound or
        grind the Afang leaves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Soak the smoked Catfish in hot water, clean to remove traces of dirt
        then shred and set aside…
      </li>
      <li>
        When the meats are well cooked, you should end up with 1-2 Cups of
        Stock. To this, add the Crayfish, blended pepper, Smoked Prawns, Smoked
        Fish, Maggi Crayfish and Periwinkles if you’re using any. Turn the heat
        down to medium. Leave to cook for 3-5. minutes….
      </li>
      <li>
        Now, add the washed Water leaves, stir and combine. Then leave to cook
        for 2-3 minutes. The Water leaves will wilt in the soup as it’s got
        quite a lot of water contents, do not be tempted to add too much.
        Remember we’ll still be adding Afang leaves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now, add the Palm oil, stir and combine, leave to cook for 3 minutes…
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the blended Okazi/ Afang leaves, stir and combine, leave to cook for
        5 minutes or until the leaves are tender enough for you. Taste for
        seasoning at this time and adjust if necessary…
      </li>
      <li>
        Switch the heat off and let it simmer with the residual heat for another
        minute or two….
      </li>
      <li>And it’s ready….</li>
      <li>Enjoy with any swallow of your choice…</li>
    </ol>
