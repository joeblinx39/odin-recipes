## Afang Soup
Afang soup is a traditional Nigerian soup made with a leafy green
vegetable called "afang" or okazi, which is native to West Africa.

The soup is typically made with a variety of meats, such as beef, goat, or
seafood, and is flavored with spices such as chili pepper, crayfish, and
seasonings like onions and bouillon cubes.
It is often served with a carbohydrate staple like pounded yam or fufu.
The soup is thick and rich, and is typically enjoyed as a main meal. It is
often considered a delicacy and is often served on special occasions or to
guests.

## Edikang Ikong Soup
In Southeastern Nigeria, among the Efik people of Cross River State and
Akwa Ibom State, is where the vegetable soup known as "edikang ikong"
first appeared.

Some Nigerians see it as a delicacy, and it is occasionally served during significant events. 
Edikang ikong is a costly, nutrient-dense soup that is mostly consumed in Nigeria by the country's wealthy. 
Beef and dried Fish, Bush meat, Crayfish, Saki (Cow tripe), Kanda, Pumpkin leaves, Water leaves, 
Onion, Periwinkle, Palm oil, Salt, and Pepper are all ingredients for edikang ikong.

## Editan Soup

Editan Soup is a vegetable soup indigenous to the Ibibios and Efiks of the
Niger Delta region of Nigeria. It is one of many vegetable soups made in
this region. Editan leaf is usually paired with waterleaf just like
Edikang Ikong and Afang soup but it has a richer, more complex flavour
than both soups. The leaves can also be paired with okro for a delicious
soup.

Editan leaf is naturally bitter like Bitter leaf, so it needs to be
processed to remove the bitterness before use, although some people cook
it without this step because they believe the bitterness has its own
medicinal value. Editan also gets slimy when it comes in contact with
water, so it needs to be washed well.
